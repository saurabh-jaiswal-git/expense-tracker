## üéØ Next Session Starting Point

### Immediate Next Task: Financial Goals Management

**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**

**Required Components**:
1. **Goal Entity** - Create Goal.java with fields:
   - id, userId, name, description, targetAmount, currentAmount
   - goalType (SAVINGS, DEBT_PAYOFF, INVESTMENT, etc.)
   - targetDate, startDate, status (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
   - progress percentage calculation

2. **Goal Repository** - Create GoalRepository.java with methods:
   - findByUserId(Long userId)
   - findByUserIdAndStatus(Long userId, GoalStatus status)
   - findByUserIdAndGoalType(Long userId, GoalType goalType)

3. **Goal Service** - Create GoalService.java with business logic:
   - createGoal(Long userId, GoalRequest request)
   - updateGoalProgress(Long goalId, BigDecimal amount)
   - getGoalProgress(Long goalId)
   - listUserGoals(Long userId)
   - completeGoal(Long goalId)

4. **Goal Controller** - Create GoalController.java with REST endpoints:
   - POST /api/goals - Create new goal
   - GET /api/goals/{goalId} - Get goal details
   - PUT /api/goals/{goalId} - Update goal
   - PUT /api/goals/{goalId}/progress - Update progress
   - GET /api/goals/user/{userId} - List user goals
   - DELETE /api/goals/{goalId} - Delete goal

5. **Goal DTOs** - Create request/response DTOs:
   - GoalRequest.java
   - GoalResponse.java
   - GoalProgressRequest.java

6. **Goal Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage:
   - GoalServiceTest.java (business logic)
   - GoalControllerTest.java (API endpoints)
   - Error scenario testing

### Testing Status
- ‚úÖ **Budget Module**: Fully tested with comprehensive error scenarios
- ‚ùå **Goals Module**: No tests yet
- ‚ùå **Analytics Module**: No tests yet
- ‚ùå **Receipt Module**: No tests yet

## üìã Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 2.1: Financial Goals (Next Priority)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 sessions

**Week 1**:
- [ ] Create Goal entity and enum classes
- [ ] Implement GoalRepository with custom queries
- [ ] Create GoalService with business logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests

**Week 2**:
- [ ] Create GoalController with REST endpoints
- [ ] Implement DTOs and validation
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Manual testing and validation

### Phase 2.2: Advanced Analytics & Reporting
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 sessions

**Features**:
- [ ] Spending trend analysis (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- [ ] Category-wise spending reports
- [ ] Budget vs actual spending analysis
- [ ] Goal progress tracking integration
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV, PDF)

### Phase 2.3: Receipt Management
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 sessions

**Features**:
- [ ] Receipt upload and storage
- [ ] OCR processing for expense extraction
- [ ] Receipt-to-transaction mapping
- [ ] Receipt search and filtering
- [ ] Receipt validation and approval workflow

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates
- New tables: `goals`, `receipts`, `analytics_cache`
- Foreign key relationships to existing tables
- Indexes for performance optimization

### API Design Patterns
- Follow existing patterns from Budget module
- Consistent error handling and validation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- RESTful endpoint design

### Integration Points
- Goals integration with budget management
- Analytics integration with transactions and budgets
- Receipt integration with transaction creation
